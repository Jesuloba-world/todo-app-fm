## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
-   [React-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For Draggable Components

### What I learned

My major takeaway from this project is how to do the drag and drop thing using react-beautiful-dnd and also, You can actually do ComponentWillMount with UseState, That's new for me.

### Continued development

In Future projects, I want to try my hands on Other ways of styling components and using a backend instead of localStorage.
